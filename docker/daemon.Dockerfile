# serve-engine daemon as a container.
#
# Build:  docker build -f docker/daemon.Dockerfile -t serve-engine:dev .
# Run:    docker run -d --name serve --network host \
#             -v ~/.serve:/root/.serve \
#             -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
#             serve-engine:dev
#
# Note: --network host is the simplest way to let the daemon spawn sibling
# engine containers and reach them by 127.0.0.1:<host_port>. With a bridge
# network, the daemon container would need the engine containers on the
# same custom network and would address them by container name.
