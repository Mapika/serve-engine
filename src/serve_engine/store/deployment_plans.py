"""History of DeploymentPlan instances submitted to the manager.

One row per `manager.load(plan)` call, captured as JSON so we don't lose
fields the `deployments` row doesn't store (extra_args,
gpu_memory_utilization, enable_*). The predictor mines this to
reconstruct a plan when it wants to pre-warm a base from scratch — the
deployments table alone isn't sufficient because:

- extra_args is operator-supplied (`-x '--max-lora-rank=N'`) and the
  current schema doesn't store it,
- rows for stopped deployments stick around but rotate when the same
  model is re-launched, so a multi-month-old plan may have been deleted,
- gpu_memory_utilization is computed at placement time and not part of
  what the operator specified — replaying needs the *operator's* intent,
  not the manager's resolved values.
