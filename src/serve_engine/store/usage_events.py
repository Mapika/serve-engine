"""Usage-event log feeding the Sub-project C predictor.

One row per request, written by the OpenAI proxy at dispatch time.
Schema is intentionally minimal — the predictor reads from indexed
columns only. Larger reasoning artifacts (per-token logs, full
prompts) are out of scope; if we ever want them they go to a
separate, opt-in `request_logs` table.
