"""LRU baseline simulator for `serve predict --replay`.

The predictor's success metric - >=30% cold-load reduction vs an LRU baseline  -
is hard to measure from production cold_loaded counters alone because they
already reflect whatever pre-warming was happening at recording time. The
replay tool answers "how would this trace have looked under naive LRU?" so
we can attribute the delta to the predictor.

Pure functions over a list of recorded events; zero daemon coupling.
