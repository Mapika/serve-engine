"""Daemon-lifespan task that runs the predictor on a fixed tick and
pre-warms adapters (and, when a recorded plan exists, base deployments)
the rules picked.

Adapter pre-warming fires whenever the rules surface an adapter candidate
and a ready base deployment with LoRA slots exists. Base pre-warming is
opt-in via `max_base_prewarm_per_tick` and only fires when the
deployment_plans history table has a successfully-loaded plan for the
base - the predictor never invents a config it hasn't seen succeed.

Guardrails per design section5: never preempt an in-flight request, never
evict pinned, cap at max_prewarm_per_tick. Predictions are advisory  -
a real request always wins.
