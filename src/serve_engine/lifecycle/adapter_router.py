"""Resolution and dispatch helpers for adapter-aware OpenAI requests.

Two pure-resolution functions (`resolve_target`, `find_deployment_for`) and
one async helper (`ensure_adapter_loaded`) that handles the
hot-load-when-needed case the proxy hits on a request for an adapter
that's not yet in any deployment.

Design: see docs/design/specs/2026-05-13-adapter-lifecycle-design.md §7.
