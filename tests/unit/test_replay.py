"""LRU replay simulator + CLI export/replay smoke tests.

The simulator is the headline metric: it backs the >=30% cold-load reduction
target by giving us an offline LRU baseline to compare recorded traces
against. Behavior we lock down:
- monotonic-clock sorting of out-of-order traces
- per-base cache isolation
- bare-base events excluded from both counters
- reduction_pct positive when recorded beats LRU; zero when LRU has nothing
  to reduce.
