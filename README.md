# serve-engine

serve-engine is a local inference router and lifecycle manager.

It gives one OpenAI-compatible endpoint to a GPU host, then manages the
services behind it: start, stop, health check, route, observe, and clean up.
The engines still do the inference. serve-engine owns the operational layer
around them.

The opinionated part is simple: engines should be replaceable, routes should
be explicit, and a single-node GPU box should not need a full platform just to
run a few reliable model services.

## Status

Works today:

- Single-node NVIDIA hosts
- Docker-backed lifecycle for engine containers
- vLLM and SGLang tested end to end through the router on a real GPU
- TensorRT-LLM backend adapter present
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`,
  `/v1/embeddings`, and `/v1/models`
- Model registry, deployments, service profiles, and explicit route rules
- API keys, admin keys, and request/token rate limits
- Prometheus metrics, GPU stats, lifecycle events, logs, and `serve top`
- Web UI bundled into the Python package

Not the focus:

- Training
- Multi-host tensor parallelism
- Being a new inference engine
- Leading with adapters or LoRA
- Replacing Kubernetes for large fleets

## Requirements

- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- Docker 24+ with NVIDIA GPU access
- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) recommended

## Install

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mapika/serve-engine
cd serve-engine
uv tool install --editable .
serve doctor
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mapika/serve-engine
cd serve-engine
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
serve doctor
```

Daemon in a container:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mapika/serve-engine
cd serve-engine
docker build -f docker/daemon.Dockerfile -t serve-engine:dev .
docker run -d --name serve \
  --network host \
  -v ~/.serve:/root/.serve \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  serve-engine:dev
```

The daemon container does not run inference itself. It talks to the host Docker
socket and starts separate engine containers.

## First Run

Start the daemon:

```bash
serve daemon start
serve daemon status
```

Create an admin key:

```bash
serve key create web --tier admin
```

Save the printed `secret:` value:

```bash
export SERVE_TOKEN=sk-...
export SERVE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11500
```

Open the web UI at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:11500/
```

Paste the admin key when prompted.

Local CLI commands use the daemon Unix socket and do not need the HTTP bearer
token. TCP admin and `/v1/*` requests need a bearer token once any key exists.

## Quick Start

Register and download a small model:

```bash
serve pull Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --name qwen-0_5b
```

Start it on GPU 0:

```bash
serve run qwen-0_5b --gpu 0 --engine vllm --pin
serve ps
```

Call the OpenAI-compatible API:

```bash
curl "$SERVE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVE_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-0_5b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with exactly: OK"}],
    "max_tokens": 8,
    "temperature": 0
  }'
```

Stop it:

```bash
serve stop
```

## Service Routes

The model commands are the fastest path for one model. Use service profiles
when you want a reusable launch definition and a stable public route.

Create a vLLM service profile:

```bash
curl -X POST "$SERVE_URL/admin/service-profiles" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVE_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "qwen-vllm",
    "model_name": "qwen-vllm",
    "hf_repo": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    "backend": "vllm",
    "gpu_ids": [0],
    "max_model_len": 1024,
    "target_concurrency": 4
  }'
```

Deploy it:

```bash
curl -X POST "$SERVE_URL/admin/service-profiles/qwen-vllm/deploy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVE_TOKEN"
```

Expose it as a public model name:

```bash
curl -X POST "$SERVE_URL/admin/routes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVE_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "chat-default",
    "match_model": "chat",
    "profile_name": "qwen-vllm",
    "priority": 10
  }'
```

Call the route:

```bash
curl "$SERVE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVE_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "chat",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

Switch `"backend": "vllm"` to `"backend": "sglang"` for the same profile shape
on SGLang.

## Concepts

**Service**

A runnable inference process. Today that is usually a vLLM, SGLang, or
TensorRT-LLM container. Later it can be a local process or remote HTTP service.

**Service profile**

A saved launch definition: backend, image, model, args, GPU placement,
concurrency, context length, and timeout policy.

**Deployment**

A running instance of a service profile. Deployments move through `pending`,
`loading`, `ready`, `stopping`, `stopped`, and `failed`.

**Route**

A rule that maps an incoming request to a service profile. The first route type
matches the OpenAI `model` field and rewrites it to the served model name.

**Backend**

The adapter that knows how to launch a specific engine. Engine-specific argv,
ports, health paths, metrics paths, and memory headroom live behind this
interface.

**Driver**

The mechanism that starts and stops services. Docker is the current driver.
Process, remote HTTP, SSH, Slurm, or Kubernetes drivers can be added behind the
same lifecycle contract.

Runtime choices:

- The daemon runs on the host as one async Python process.
- Engine services run in separate containers.
- Containers bind to random localhost ports.
- The router only sends traffic to ready deployments.
- State lives in SQLite under `~/.serve`.
- Engine defaults come from `src/serve_engine/backends/backends.yaml`.
- Per-host engine overrides live in `~/.serve/backends.override.yaml`.

## Files

By default, serve-engine owns `~/.serve`. Override it with `SERVE_HOME`.

```text
~/.serve/
|-- db.sqlite               models, deployments, profiles, routes, keys, usage
|-- sock                    local CLI control socket
|-- logs/
|   `-- daemon.log          daemon stdout and stderr
|-- models/                 downloaded Hugging Face model files
|   `-- models--owner--repo/snapshots/revision/
|-- configs/                per-deployment engine configs
|-- predictor.yaml          optional prewarm and prediction tuning
`-- backends.override.yaml  optional engine image and headroom overrides
```

## Operations Notes

- Run `serve doctor` before debugging anything else.
- Use `serve ps` for deployment state.
- Use `serve logs` when an engine fails to become healthy.
- Use `/admin/events` or `serve top` for lifecycle visibility.
- Use `--pin` for services that should stay loaded.
- Use `--idle-timeout` for services that should leave the GPU when quiet.
- Use service profiles when launch arguments need to be repeatable.
- Use routes when the public model name should not be tied to one backend.

## Performance Snapshot

Single H100 80 GB, Qwen2.5 0.5B and 1.5B, 512-token outputs, Poisson arrivals.
Raw benchmark JSON lives in `docs/bench/`.

| QPS | Model and Engine | Agg TPS | TTFT p50 ms | E2E p50 ms |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0.5B vLLM | 355 | 25 | 1134 |
| 16 | 0.5B vLLM | 7169 | 33 | 1429 |
| 32 | 0.5B SGLang | 14751 | 68 | 1280 |
| 16 | 1.5B SGLang | 7904 | 38 | 1608 |
| 32 | 1.5B vLLM | 13377 | 128 | 2814 |

Treat these as a sanity check, not a universal benchmark. Engine version, model
family, context length, quantization, and GPU all matter.

## Design Docs

Current direction:

- `docs/design/specs/2026-05-14-service-router-control-plane.md`

Historical implementation notes live in `docs/design/plans/` and older files
under `docs/design/specs/`. Older adapter and snapshot notes are retained as
history. The current direction is service routing and lifecycle control.

## Development

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/unit
ruff check src/ tests/
```

UI build:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run build
```

## Out Of Scope For V1

- Multi-host tensor parallel inference
- Training or fine-tuning
- Full autotuning of tensor parallelism, dtype, and context length
- Built-in TLS termination
- A Kubernetes replacement

Bind to `127.0.0.1` by default. Put a reverse proxy in front when exposing it
outside the host.
